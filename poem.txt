I like ponies.

Mhm baby ponies are only to be eaten as a last resort. 
Although their cute plump bodies taste delicious, while engorging yourself on their meat it is important to pace yourself.
While unicorns are distant cousins to adorable ponies it should be noted that they do not taste the same. 
Also note that different cooking and more involved preparation methods may be required for unicorn meat.
